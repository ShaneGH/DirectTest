ValidateMethod, check return type if possible

out vals by name rather than by index
validate: if property is mocked with something complex (e.g. Dx.Property<>(...)) and property cannot be mocked, only set, return error
Overhaul of ObjectBaseValidator class
mess with IL http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/14058/Parsing-the-IL-of-a-Method-Body
Mock events
out parameters in mocked methods
Abstract test. A test as part of a module which is not run, only used by other tests
Mock settings: var mock = Dx.Mock(); mock(new {Returns = "banana"}).DoSomething(...); // what about next mock. Is "banana" still in efect

Static classes, Classes with private constructors, Classes inside non public or internal classes
Override method with generic constraints (interface and class)

Hubris:
No records, no mocks vs stubs, no It<int>.Is.Anything, no endless lambdas, no Setup() and it's significantly faster than all of the leading mocking libraries
